# Learn Python! [https://ist256.com](https://ist256.com)

Source Code Repository for learning python, based on My IST256 Python course at Syracuse University!

This code is free for use by other instructors and self-directed learners alike. If you want to teach Python programming or learn it you've come to the right place!

## Important

If you're enrolled in IST256 at Syracuse University, you should NOT use this Repository. Instead you will use our hosted JupyterHub programming environment.

## Setup

The programming environment uses Jupyter Notebooks and runs in a docker container. You must have Docker installed on your computer to run the container. To get docker visit: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Once docker is setup you can bring up the notebook using Docker Compose from the command line:

`docker-compose up`

You will see a link to the Jupyter application in the logs. click on it to open Jupyter!

When you need to shut down Jupyter, go back to the logs and press `CTRL` + `C` to stop. Then from the command line type:

`docker-compose down`

Assigned readings, lecture videos, lab walk through, and homework advice can be found on the course website [https://ist256.com](https://ist256.com)


Happy Programming!

Best,
Michael
